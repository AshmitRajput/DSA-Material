                                TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY
  constraints like 1<n<10^6
  or 1<n<1000


  Time Complexity - Measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative
   to the input size (usually denoted as n). 
   It captures the number of steps (operations) your program will 
   execute as input increases.

  Space Complexity: Measures how much extra memory an algorithm 
  requires as input size increases.

  Always optimize for the worst-case in competitive 
  programming unless problem states otherwise.

  Before coding, estimate allowed operations 
  (e.g., 1 second â‰ˆ 100 million simple operations).

  If your initial solution is too slow, look for a more 
  efficient algorithm (typically, reducing a nested loop or using 
  better data structures).

  Use libraries for standard complex operations when 
  allowed (like built-in sorts).


  for them to avoid TLE:
        <[10...11]   - O(n!).O(n^6)  
        <[15...18]   - O(2^n * n^2)
        <[100]       - O(n^4)
        <[400]       - O(n^3)
        <[2000]      - O(n^2 * log n)
        <[10^4]      - O(n^2)
        <[10^6]      - O(nlog n)
        <[10^8]      - O(n), O(log n)
